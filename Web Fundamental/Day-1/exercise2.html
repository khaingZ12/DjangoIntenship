    <h3>Fruits</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as
        angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long
        propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic
        relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition
        for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on
        fruits as a source of food.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Vegetables</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
        animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied
        to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers,
        fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is
        applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may
        exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and
        cereal grains, but include savory fruits such as tomatoes and corvettes, flowers
        such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
